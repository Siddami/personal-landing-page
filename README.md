## Project Overview

This project is a simple **personal landing page** built to fulfill a frontend assignment brief for mentorled microship task.

## Thought Process & Approach

### Tech Stack

I chose the following technologies for their speed, flexibility, and developer experience:

- **Vite + React** – Fast setup and modular component structure
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first responsive design with clean, scalable CSS
- **Framer Motion** – For smooth animations and enhanced interactivity
- **Deployed via netlify** – Easy and quick live deployment

### My Goals

- Build a **clean and accessible layout**
- Ensure **responsiveness on all screen sizes**
- Maintain **clarity, focus, and minimalism** in content
- Integrate **smooth animations** to improve user experience
- Follow **component-based architecture** for maintainability

## Components

- `About` – Contains a structured personal introduction with a responsive layout
- `Contact` – Provides a clickable email link for connection
- `Navbar` – Animated, interactive navigation with active state management
- `Loader` – Simple loading animation using Framer Motion

- Clear alt text for all images
- Keyboard-accessible links and buttons
- Responsive layout tested across multiple screen sizes (mobile to desktop)
